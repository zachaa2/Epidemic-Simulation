Epidemic Simulation Application
Author: Aaron Zachariah
Operating System: Windows 10
Tested using Java version 17.0.3.1


RUNNING THE APPLICATION:
To start the application, you must run the "start" script. There will be two versions, one is a cmd script an one is a bash script.
Make sure to run the correct script for your Operating system. 

Simply open the terminal, navigate to the scripts folder and run the correct script. Double-clicking the script
directly from the folder may also work. The application first uses input files to load network data in.
There will be some example graph files in the bin directory. Please refer to the User Manual (manual.pdf)
for more information regarding the format of input files.

The extra bin directory holds class files and example intup files. Also check the report directory for 
data and analysis regarding the execution time of this application on multiple threads.
The lib directory contains extra dependencies used in the application.
